## Usage

For now, you can visit websites and freely explore their features. If the extension detects a request that might be exploitable, it will automatically attempt certain actions. You can view the results in the extension's service. To access the service:

1. Open Google Chrome.

2. Navigate to the extension menu by clicking on the extension icon in the toolbar.

3. Select "Inspect views" and then choose "Service Worker".

4. Here, you can monitor the activity and results of the extension's actions when it detects potential exploits.
