### Who knows what an extension is???

### What extensions actually are

Extensions are JavaScript programs that run either in the background or within the same execution environment as a webpage.

### Why I Started Developing a Chrome Extension

It all began with my frustration at school, specifically with the cumbersome process of viewing documents on LEHO. I had to scroll three times just to see a single page in its entirety.

![leho](readme/leho.png)

This led me to write a small piece of JavaScript and execute it in the console. Later, I evolved this script into a bookmarklet. However, I still found it inconvenient to open a document and press the bookmark each time. Thus, I embarked on a quest to find a way to automatically execute JavaScript whenever a LEHO document was opened. This journey led me to the world of browser extensions.

Although there were existing extensions like Tampermonkey that could potentially meet my needs, they didn't perform exactly as I wanted it. They were either too complex for my simple requirements or failed to function in the desired manner. As a result, I decided to develop my own extension.

### Why a chrome extension?

The biggest reason: chrome is my default browser.
Afterwards, when thinking more about it: the chrome browser itself has a marketshare of ~65%, safari ~15% (but i dont have a macbook so this wouldnt be feasable), firefox ~5% and the last ~15% are the other browsers and a lot of those are chromium based.

![alt text](readme/browser_stat.png)

Although initially i tried to develop the extensions for both Firefox and Chromium-based browsers i found Google's documentation to be superior. Furthermore, after spending hours trying to make it work on Firefox without success, I decided to focus on Chromium-based browsers, which also offered the advantage of wider applicability due to their increasing market share.

### development proces

The first automatic exploit I worked on involved an XML attack, which I learned about from an article. After successfully implementing this exploit, I took the time to modularize my code, breaking it down into separate files and folders for better organization and maintenance. This also enabled me to add a "module" to insert new exploits when they got developed.

#### Key Components of the Extension

Before i start explaining the exploits there are some things we need to get fimiliar with:

- **manifest.json**: This file acts as the backbone of a Chrome extension. It configures the extension, declaring its major components, and requests the necessary permissions to function properly.

- **background.js**: Think of this as the JavaScript powering the entire browser's extension environment. While it can't interact directly with the content of each tab, it can intercept requests and manage broader extension activities.

- **offscreen.html**: This HTML file exists within the same operational context as a browsers tab but remains invisible to the user. It's a hidden layer where certain extension processes can run in the background.

- **offscreen.js --renamed to--> listener.js**: Associated with offscreen.html, this JavaScript file is dedicated to monitoring specific events or "attacks" in the extension's hidden realm. It's where we listen for and respond to various triggers.

- **content.js**: This script runs in the context of each browser tab, directly interacting with the web content. It's isolated to the tab it operates in, ensuring that its actions are tab-specific and do not interfere with the broader browser or other tabs.

- **popup.html/js**: This is the screen you see when you click the extensions icon and where we see the results for a current tab

- **options.html/js --renamed to--> settings.html/js**: Here we set some settings mainly filters for results/urls to ignore for a pentest

#### Issues

##### Scope

During the development process, I encountered multiple challenges with the scope of js variables and methods, and also the storage.

![complicated scheme of the scope](readme/scope.webp)

As you can see its not as easy to understand, so ill simplify it:

First the javascript scopes
you have a browser(accessed with the background.js) it has tabs(accessed with the content.js)
these each have their scope and can only talk to each other with postmessages
we also startup an offscreen html page this is loaded from the background and also has its own scope
here we

all of these except for the content.js are modules, so these can use the import method wich is usefull for separating different methods into different files, but bcs the content.js is not a module i had to copy paste some methods that i wanted to use in my content

there also are the popup and settings but these also have its own scope and but get reloaded each time you open these so these dont really need to share data directly (except for the stored data)

then there is the storage scope,
although localstorage and cookies is easy to implement it can only be accesed from the content.js
but we needed storage that could be accessed from each part of the extension
thus i found indexeddb, although this is relatively slow it get the job done

##### Results

In the beginning i always opened the extensions dev console and console logged each response,
although for development this is easy and fast to check if something works or not i dont want this in my end product
there fore i started looking into how i could save the results
and then i also had to figure out how to show these, in the end i choose to save them in the indexeddb and show the results of a current page when clicking the extensions icon

#### Tools and Methodology

There where also tools, that i used, to debug, to understand, to explore the internet:

For examining and modifying requests, I utilized Burp Suite by Dafydd Stuttard, a tool that lets you intercept, view, and modify the requests sent from your browser. My approach involved intercepting every request using background JavaScript. This method allowed for real-time monitoring and modification of requests before they were completed, offering insights into potential exploits.

Chrome DevTools: This integrated set of tools is built directly into the Google Chrome browser, allowing developers to edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which helps in understanding the detailed workings of web applications. I used Chrome DevTools extensively for inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, observing network activity, and managing browser storage among other things.

Google Documentation: Google's comprehensive documentation resources were invaluable for understanding best practices and how to effectively use various APIs and services. I frequently referred to Google's developer documentation to ensure that I was using the most up-to-date and efficient methods available.

ChatGPT: For synthesizing information, explaining complex concepts in simpler terms, spellchecking, and generating images, I used ChatGPT. It was particularly helpful not only for quick summaries and clarifications on technical topics but also for creating visual content that aided in illustrating points and enhancing presentations. The ability to generate images helped in visualizing concepts that were otherwise abstract and difficult to convey through text alone.

Each tool played a critical role in enhancing my capability to develop, troubleshoot, and optimize my applications efficiently.

#### Exploiting and Refining

### - adding more explanations of the other exploits and show pocs

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to a known location on your system, for example, `~/chrome-extension`.

2. Open Google Chrome.

3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.

4. Enable developer mode by toggling the switch located at the top right corner.

5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder where you cloned this repository (`~/chrome-extension`).

6. The extension should now be loaded into Chrome.

7. Navigate to a webpage that you wish to test for vulnerabilities.

### How to use

For now, you can visit websites and freely explore their features. If the extension detects a request that might be exploitable, it will automatically attempt certain actions. You can view the results in the extension's service. To access the service:

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Surf website you may leggaly pentest
3. After a while, if there are any exploits that succeeded, there will show a badge with the amount of exploits that succeeded, then you can click on the popup and it will show the exploits with a button to copy the executed exploit
