# plan of approach

01. figure out how an extension works
02. what extensions all can do
03. find out how to make an extension
    repeat the next ones
04. find an exploit
05. figure out how to automate it
06. implement it in the extension
07. test it
08. document the why and how
09. cleanup code
    repeat until here
